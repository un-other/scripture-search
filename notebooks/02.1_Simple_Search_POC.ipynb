      "Original Text:  I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on a tour of Kasi with a large Sangha of monks. There he addressed the monks: \"I abstain from the nighttime meal.1 As I am abstaining from the nighttime meal, I sense next-to-no illness, next-to-no affliction, lightness, strength, & comfortable abiding. Come, now. You, too, abstain from the nighttime meal. As you are abstaining from the nighttime meal, you, too, will sense next-to-no illness, next-to-no affliction, lightness, strength, & comfortable abiding.\" \"As you say, lord,\" the monks responded to him. Then, as he was wandering by stages in Kasi, the Blessed One eventually arrived at a Kasi town called Kitagiri. And there he stayed in the Kasi town, Kitagiri. Now at that time the monks led by Assaji & Punabbasu2 were residing in Kitagiri. Then a large number of monks went to them and, on arrival, said to them, \"The Blessed One and the Sangha of monks abstain from the nighttime meal. As they are abstaining from the nighttime meal, they sense next-to-no illness, next-to-no affliction, lightness, strength, & comfortable abiding. Come now, friends. You, too, abstain from the nighttime meal. As you are abstaining from the nighttime meal, you, too, will sense next-to-no illness, next-to-no affliction, lightness, strength, & comfortable abiding.\" When this was said, the monks led by Assaji & Punabbasu said to those monks, \"Friends, we eat in the evening, in the morning, & in the wrong-time during the day. As we are eating in the evening, and in the morning, & in the wrong-time during the day, we sense next-to-no illness, next-to-no affliction, lightness, strength, & comfortable abiding. Why should we, abandoning what is immediately visible, chase after something subject to time? We will eat in the evening, in the morning, & in the wrong-time during the day.\" When they were unable to convince the monks led by Assaji & Punabbasu, those monks went to the Blessed One [and told him what had happened]. Then the Blessed One told a certain monk, \"Come, monk. In my name, call the monks led by Assaji & Punabbasu, saying, 'The Teacher calls you, friends.'\" \"As you say, lord,\" the monk answered and, having gone to the monks led by Assaji & Punabbasu, on arrival he said, \"The Teacher calls you, friends.\" \"As you say, friend,\" the monks led by Assaji & Punabbasu replied. Then they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, \"Is it true, monks, that a large number of monks went to you... and you said, '...Why should we, abandoning what is immediately visible, chase after something subject to time? We will eat in the evening, in the morning, & in the wrong-time during the day.'\" \"Yes, lord.\" \"Monks, have you ever understood me to teach the Dhamma in this way: 'Whatever a person experiences--pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful--his unskillful qualities decrease and his skillful qualities grow'?\" \"No, lord.\" \"And haven't you understood me to teach the Dhamma in this way: 'For someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decrease. But there is the case where, for someone feeling a pleasant feeling of that sort, unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities grow.

And if it were not known by me--not seen, not observed, not realized, not touched through discernment--that 'For someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decrease,' then would it be fitting for me, not knowing that, to say, 'Abandon that sort of pleasant feeling'?\" \"No, lord.\" \"But because it is known by me--seen, observed, realized, touched through discernment--that 'For someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decrease,' I therefore say, 'Abandon that sort of pleasant feeling.' \"If it were not known by me--not seen, not observed, not realized, not touched through discernment--that 'For someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort, unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities grow,' then would it be fitting for me, not knowing that, to say, 'Enter & remain in that sort of pleasant feeling'?\" \"No, lord.\" \"But because it is known by me--seen, observed, realized, touched through discernment--that 'For someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort, unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities grow,' I therefore say, 'Enter & remain in that sort of pleasant feeling.'

Envisioning this fruit of heedfulness for this monk, I say that he has a task to do with heedfulness. \"Monks, I do not say that the attainment of gnosis is all at once. Rather, the attainment of gnosis is after gradual training, gradual action, gradual practice. And how is there the attainment of gnosis after gradual training, gradual action, gradual practice? There is the case where, when conviction has arisen, one visits (a teacher). Having visited, one grows close. Having grown close, one lends ear. Having lent ear, one hears the Dhamma. Having heard the Dhamma, one remembers it. Remembering, one penetrates the meaning of the teachings. Penetrating the meaning, one comes to an agreement through pondering the teachings. There being an agreement through pondering the teachings, desire arises. When desire has arisen, one is willing. When one is willing, one contemplates. Having contemplated, one makes an exertion. Having made an exertion, one realizes with the body the ultimate truth and, having penetrated it with discernment, sees it.9 \"Now, monks, there hasn't been that conviction, there hasn't been that visiting, there hasn't been that growing close... that lending ear... that hearing of the Dhamma... that remembering... that penetration of the meaning of the teachings... that agreement through pondering the teachings... that desire... that willingness... that contemplation... that exertion. You have lost the way, monks. You have gone the wrong way, monks. How far have you strayed, foolish men, from this Dhamma & Discipline! \"Monks, there is a four-phrased statement that, when it is recited, an observant man will in no long time learn the meaning through discernment. I will recite it, and you learn it from me.\" \"But, lord, who are we to be learners of the Dhamma?\" \"Monks, even with a teacher devoted to material things, an heir of material things, who lives attached to material things, this sort of haggling (by his students) wouldn't be proper: 'If we get this, we'll do it; if we don't, we won't.' So how could it be with regard to the Tathagata, who dwells entirely detached from material things? \"For a disciple who has conviction in the Teacher's message & lives to penetrate it, what accords with the Dhamma is this: 'The Blessed One is the Teacher, I am a disciple. He is the one who knows, not I.' For a disciple who has conviction in the Teacher's message & lives to penetrate it, the Teacher's message is healing & nourishing. For a disciple who has conviction in the Teacher's message & lives to penetrate it, what accords with the Dhamma is this: 'Gladly would I let the flesh & blood in my body dry up, leaving just the skin, tendons, & bones, but if I have not attained what can be reached through manly firmness, manly persistence, manly striving, there will be no relaxing my persistence.' For a disciple who has conviction in the Teacher's message & lives to penetrate it, one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis here & now, or--if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance--non-return.\" That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words. Notes 1. Pacittiya 37 forbids monks from eating during the period from noon until the following dawn. According to MN 66, the Buddha introduced this restriction in stages, first forbidding the afternoon meal, and then the nighttime meal. 2. Assaji and Punabbasu were two of the six ringleaders of the notorious \"group-of-six\" monks, whose misbehavior led to the formulation of many rules in the Vinaya. (The group is named after the number of ringleaders, not the number of members, which--according to the Commentary--reached more than one thousand.) In the origin story to Sanghadisesa 13, the monks led by Assaji and Punabbasu behaved in many inappropriate ways to please the lay families of Kitagiri, to the point where the Kitagiri laypeople ridiculed well-behaved monks and refused to give them alms. The Pali phrase for \"monks led by Assaji and Punabbasu\" is assaji-punabbasuka bhikkhu. Both MLS and MLDB mistakenly treat this phrase as the names of two monks, Assaji and Punabbasuka. Actually, the -ka at the end of the compound name is a suffix that converts it into an adjective, describing a group following Assaji and Punabbasu. 3. On the mental faculties, see SN 48:10. On heedfulness, see SN 48:56 and SN 55:40. 4. See DN 15 and AN 9:45. 5. See AN 9:44. 6. See AN 9:43. According to the Commentary, this category includes all noble ones (except for those who have reached the fruit of arahantship) who have also attained any of the formless dimensions. 7. According to the Commentary, this category and the following one include all noble ones (except for those who have reached the fruit of arahantship) who have not attained any of the formless dimensions. 8. According to the Commentary, this category and the following one include those who have reached the path to stream-entry, but not yet the fruit of stream-entry. 9. The steps of the practice, as presented here, follow the same sequence as that discussed in MN 95. However, in that sutta, the sequence is prefaced by instructions on how to determine whether a teacher is worthy of conviction.

      "Title:  The Ball of Honey\n",
      "Original Text:  This discourse plays a central role in the early Buddhist analysis of conflict. As might be expected, the blame for conflict lies within, in the unskillful habits of the mind, rather than without. The culprit in this case is a habit called papanca. Unfortunately, none of the early texts give a clear definition of what the word papanca means, so it's hard to find a precise English equivalent for the term. However, they do give a clear analysis of how papanca arises, how it leads to conflict, and how it can be ended. In the final analysis, these are the questions that matter--more than the precise definition of terms--so we will deal with them first before proposing a few possible translation equivalents for the word. Three passages in the discourses--DN 21, MN 18, and Sn 4:11--map the causal processes that give rise to papanca and lead from papanca to conflict. Because the Buddhist analysis of causality is generally non-linear, with plenty of room for feedback loops, the maps vary in some of their details. In DN 21, the map reads like this: the perceptions & categories of papanca > thinking > desire > dear-&-not-dear > envy & stinginess > rivalry & hostility In Sn 4:11, the map is less linear and can be diagrammed like this: perception > the categories of papanca perception > name & form > contact > appealing & unappealing > desire > dear-&-not-dear > stinginess/divisiveness/quarrels/disputes In MN 18, the map is this: contact > feeling > perception > thinking > the perceptions & categories of papanca In this last case, however, the bare outline misses some of the important implications of the way this process is phrased. In the full passage, the analysis starts out in an impersonal tone: \"Dependent on eye & forms, eye-consciousness arises [similarly with the rest of the six senses]. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a requisite condition, there is feeling.\" Starting with feeling, the notion of an \"agent\"--in this case, the feeler--acting on \"objects,\" is introduced: \"What one feels, one perceives [labels in the mind]. What one perceives, one thinks about. What one thinks about, one 'papancizes.'\" Through the process of papanca, the agent then becomes a victim of his/her own patterns of thinking: \"Based on what a person papancizes, the perceptions & categories of papanca assail him/her with regard to past, present, & future forms cognizable via the eye [as with the remaining senses].\" What are these perceptions & categories that assail the person who papancizes? Sn 4:14 states that the root of the categories of papanca is the perception, \"I am the thinker.\" From this self-reflexive thought--in which one objectifies a \"self,\" a thing corresponding to the concept of \"I\"-- a number of categories can be derived: being/not-being, me/not-me, mine/not-mine, doer/done-to, signifier/signified. Once one's self becomes a thing under the rubric of these categories, it's impossible not to be assailed by the perceptions & categories derived from these basic distinctions. When there's the sense of identification as a being that needs to feed (see Khp 4), then based on the feelings arising from sensory contact, some feelings will seem appealing--worth feeding on--and others will seem worth pushing away. From this there grows desire, which comes into conflict with the desires of others who are also feeding because they, too, engage in papanca. This is how inner objectification breeds external contention. How can this process be ended? Through a shift in perception, caused by the way one attends to feelings, using the categories of appropriate attention (see MN 2). As the Buddha states in DN 21, rather than viewing a feeling as an appealing or unappealing thing, one should look at it as part of a causal process: When a particular feeling is pursued, do skillful or unskillful qualities increase in the mind? If skillful qualities increase, the feeling may be pursued. If unskillful qualities increase, it shouldn't. When comparing feelings that lead to skillful qualities, notice that those endowed with thinking (directed thought) and evaluation are less refined than those free of thinking and evaluation, as in the higher stages of mental absorption, or jhana. When seeing this, there is a tendency to opt for the more refined feelings, and this cuts through the act of thinking that, according to MN 18, provides the basis for papanca. In following this program, the notion of agent and victim is avoided, as is self-reflexive thinking in general. There is simply the analysis of cause-effect processes. One is still making use of dualities--distinguishing between unskillful and skillful (and affliction/lack of affliction, the results of unskillful and skillful qualities)--but the distinction is between processes, not things. Thus one's analysis avoids the type of thinking that, according to DN 21, depends on the perceptions and categories of papanca, and in this way the vicious cycle by which thinking and papanca keep feeding each other is cut. Ultimately, by following this program to greater and greater levels of refinement through the higher levels of mental absorption, one finds less and less to relish and enjoy in the six senses and the mental processes based on them. With this sense of disenchantment, the processes of feeling and thought are stilled, and there is a breakthrough to the cessation of the six sense spheres. When these spheres cease, is there anything else left? Ven. Sariputta, in AN 4:173 warns us not to ask, for to ask if there is, isn't, both-is-and-isn't, neither-is-nor-isn't anything left in that dimension is to papancize what is free from papanca. However, this dimension is not a total annihilation of experience. It's a type of experience that DN 11 calls consciousness without surface, luminous all around, where water, earth, fire, & wind have no footing, where long/short, coarse/fine, fair/foul, name/form are all brought to an end. This is the fruit of the path of arahantship--a path that makes use of dualities but leads to a fruit beyond them. It may come as cold comfort to realize that conflict can be totally overcome only with the realization of arahantship, but it's important to note that by following the path recommended in DN 21--learning to avoid references to any notion of \"self\" and learning to view feelings not as things but as parts of a causal process affecting the qualities in the mind--the basis for papanca is gradually undercut, and there are fewer and fewer occasions for conflict. In following this path, one reaps its increasing benefits all along the way. Translating papanca: As one writer has noted, the word papanca has had a wide variety of meanings in Indian thought, with only one constant: In Buddhist philosophical discourse it carries negative connotations, usually of falsification and distortion. The word itself is derived from a root that means diffuseness, spreading, proliferating. The Pali Commentaries define papanca as covering three types of thought: craving, conceit, and views. They also note that it functions to slow the mind down in its escape from samsara. Because its categories begin with the objectifying thought, \"I am the thinker,\" I have chosen to render the word as \"objectification,\" although some of the following alternatives might be acceptable as well: self-reflexive thinking, reification, proliferation, complication, elaboration, distortion. The word offers some interesting parallels to the postmodern notion of logocentric thinking, but it's important to note that the Buddha's program of deconstructing this process differs sharply from that of postmodern thought. * * * I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park. Then in the early morning, having adjusted his lower robe and taking his bowl & outer robe, he went into Kapilavatthu for alms. Having gone for alms in Kapilavatthu, after the meal, returning from his alms round, he went to the Great Forest for the day's abiding. Plunging into the Great Forest, he sat down at the root of a young clump of bamboo for the day's abiding. Dandapanin [\"Stick-in-hand\"] the Sakyan, out roaming & rambling for exercise, also went to the Great Forest. Plunging into the Great Forest, he went to the Blessed One under the young clump of bamboo. On arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he stood to one side. As he was standing there, he said to the Blessed One, \"What is the contemplative's doctrine? What does he proclaim?\" \"The sort of doctrine, friend, where one does not keep quarreling with anyone in the cosmos with its devas, Maras, & Brahmas, with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk; the sort (of doctrine) where perceptions no longer obsess the brahman who remains dissociated from sensuality, free from perplexity, his uncertainty cut away, devoid of craving for becoming & non-. Such is my doctrine; such is what I proclaim.\" When this was said, Dandapanin the Sakyan--shaking his head, wagging his tongue, raising his eyebrows so that his forehead was wrinkled in three furrows--left, leaning on his stick. Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion in the evening, went to the Banyan Park and, on arrival, sat down on a seat made ready. Having sat down, he [told the monks what had happened]. When this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One, \"Lord, what sort of doctrine is it where one does not keep quarreling with anyone in the cosmos with its devas, Maras, & Brahmas, with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk; where perceptions no longer obsess the brahman who remains dissociated from sensuality, free from perplexity, his uncertainty cut away, devoid of craving for becoming & non-?\" \"If, monk, with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions & categories of objectification assail a person, there is nothing there to relish, welcome, or remain fastened to, then that is the end of the obsessions of passion, the obsessions of resistance, the obsessions of views, the obsessions of uncertainty, the obsessions of conceit, the obsessions of passion for becoming, & the obsessions of ignorance. That is the end of taking up rods & bladed weapons, of arguments, quarrels, disputes, accusations, divisive speech, & false speech. That is where these evil, unskillful things cease without remainder.\" That is what the Blessed One said. Having said it, he--the One Well-Gone--got up from his seat and went into his dwelling. Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, this thought occurred to the monks: \"This brief statement the Blessed One made, after which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning--i.e., 'If, with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions & categories of objectification assail a person, there is nothing to relish... that is where these evil, unskillful things cease without remainder': Now who might analyze the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement?\" Then the thought occurred to them, \"Ven. Maha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his observant companions in the holy life. He is capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement. Suppose we were to go to him and, on arrival, cross-question him about this matter.\" So the monks went to Ven. Maha Kaccana and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, they sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they [told him what had happened, and added,] \"Analyze the meaning, Ven. Maha Kaccana!\" (He replied:) \"Friends, it's as if a man needing heartwood, looking for heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood--passing over the root & trunk of a standing tree possessing heartwood--were to imagine that heartwood should be sought among its branches & leaves. So it is with you, who--having bypassed the Blessed One when you were face to face with him, the Teacher--imagine that I should be asked about this matter. For knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees. He is the Eye, he is Knowledge, he is Dhamma, he is Brahma. He is the speaker, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver of the deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathagata. That was the time when you should have cross-questioned him about this matter. However he answered, that was how you should have remembered it.\" \"Yes, friend Kaccana: Knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees. He is the Eye, he is Knowledge, he is Dhamma, he is Brahma. He is the speaker, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver of the deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathagata. That was the time when we should have cross-questioned him about this matter. However he answered, that was how we should have remembered it. But you are praised by the Teacher and esteemed by your observant companions in the holy life. You are capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement. Analyze the meaning, Ven. Maha Kaccana, without making it difficult!\" \"In that case, my friends, listen & pay close attention. I will speak.\" \"As you say, friend,\" the monks responded to him. Ven. Maha Kaccana said this: \"Friends, concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made, after which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning--i.e., 'If, with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions & categories of objectification assail a person, there is nothing there to relish, welcome, or remain fastened to, then that is the end of the obsessions of passion, the obsessions of resistance, the obsessions of views, the obsessions of uncertainty, the obsessions of conceit, the obsessions of passion for becoming, & the obsessions of ignorance. That is the end of taking up rods & bladed weapons, of arguments, quarrels, disputes, accusations, divisive speech, & false speech. That is where these evil, unskillful things cease without remainder'--I understand the detailed meaning to be this: \"Dependent on eye & forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a requisite condition, there is feeling. What one feels, one perceives [labels in the mind]. What one perceives, one thinks about. What one thinks about, one complicates. Based on what a person complicates, the perceptions & categories of objectification assail him/her with regard to past, present, & future forms cognizable via the eye. \"Dependent on ear & sounds, ear-consciousness arises.... \"Dependent on nose & aromas, nose-consciousness arises.... \"Dependent on tongue & flavors, tongue-consciousness arises.... \"Dependent on body & tactile sensations, body-consciousness arises.... \"Dependent on intellect & ideas, intellect-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a requisite condition, there is feeling. What one feels, one perceives. What one perceives, one thinks about. What one thinks about, one complicates. Based on what a person complicates, the perceptions & categories of objectification assail him/her with regard to past, present, & future ideas cognizable via the intellect. \"Now, when there is the eye, when there are forms, when there is eye-consciousness, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of contact.1 When there is a delineation of contact, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of feeling. When there is a delineation of feeling, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of perception. When there is a delineation of perception, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking. When there is a delineation of thinking, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions & categories of objectification. \"When there is the ear.... \"When there is the nose.... \"When there is the tongue.... \"When there is the body.... \"When there is the intellect, when there are ideas, when there is intellect-consciousness, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of contact. When there is a delineation of contact, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of feeling. When there is a delineation of feeling, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of perception. When there is a delineation of perception, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking. When there is a delineation of thinking, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions & categories of objectification. \"Now, when there is no eye, when there are no forms, when there is no eye-consciousness, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of contact. When there is no delineation of contact, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of feeling. When there is no delineation of feeling, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of perception. When there is no delineation of perception, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking. When there is no delineation of thinking, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions & categories of objectification. \"When there is no ear.... \"When there is no nose.... \"When there is no tongue.... \"When there is no body.... \"When there is no intellect, when there are no ideas, when there is no intellect-consciousness, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of contact. When there is no delineation of contact, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of feeling. When there is no delineation of feeling, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of perception. When there is no delineation of perception, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking. When there is no delineation of thinking, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions & categories of objectification. \"So, concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made, after which he entered his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning--i.e., 'If, with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions & categories of objectification assail a person, there is nothing there to relish, welcome, or remain fastened to, then that is the end of the obsessions of passion, the obsessions of resistance, the obsessions of views, the obsessions of uncertainty, the obsessions of conceit, the obsessions of passion for becoming, & the obsessions of ignorance. That is the end of taking up rods & bladed weapons, of arguments, quarrels, disputes, accusations, divisive speech, & false speech. That is where these evil, unskillful things cease without remainder'--this is how I understand the detailed meaning. Now, friends, if you wish, having gone to the Blessed One, cross-question him about this matter. However he answers is how you should remember it.\" Then the monks, delighting in & approving of Ven. Maha Kaccana's words, got up from their seats and went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to him, they sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they [told him what had happened after he had gone into his dwelling, and ended by saying,] \"Then Ven. Maha Kaccana analyzed the meaning using these words, these statements, these phrases.\" \"Maha Kaccana is wise, monks. He is a person of great discernment. If you had asked me about this matter, I too would have answered in the same way he did. That is its meaning, and that is how you should remember it.\" When this was said, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, \"Lord, it's as if a man--overcome with hunger, weakness, & thirst--were to come across a ball of honey. Wherever he might taste it, he would experience a sweet, delectable flavor. In the same way, wherever a monk of capable awareness might investigate the meaning of this Dhamma discourse with his discernment, he would experience gratification, he would experience confidence. What is the name of this Dhamma discourse?\" \"Then, Ananda, you can remember this Dhamma discourse as the 'Ball of Honey Discourse.'\" That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. Ananda delighted in the Blessed One's words. Note 1. The artificiality of this phrase--\"delineate a delineation\"--seems intentional. It underlines the artifice implicit in the process by which the mind, in singling out events, turns them into discrete things. See MN 109, note 2.

      "Title:  All the Effluents\n",
      "Original Text:  I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. There he addressed the monks: \"Monks!\" \"Yes, lord,\" the monks responded to him. The Blessed One said, \"Monks, the ending of the effluents is for one who knows & sees, I tell you, not for one who doesn't know & doesn't see. For one who knows what & sees what? Appropriate attention & inappropriate attention. When a monk attends inappropriately, unarisen effluents arise, and arisen effluents increase. When a monk attends appropriately, unarisen effluents do not arise, and arisen effluents are abandoned. There are effluents to be abandoned by seeing, those to be abandoned by restraining, those to be abandoned by using, those to be abandoned by tolerating, those to be abandoned by avoiding, those to be abandoned by destroying, and those to be abandoned by developing. \"[1] And what are the effluents to be abandoned by seeing? There is the case where an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person--who has no regard for noble ones, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma; who has no regard for people of integrity, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma--doesn't discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attention. This being so, he doesn't attend to ideas fit for attention and attends (instead) to ideas unfit for attention. \"And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises in him, and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases; the unarisen effluent of becoming arises in him, and the arisen effluent of becoming increases; the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises in him, and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases. These are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to. \"And what are the ideas fit for attention that he doesn't attend to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of sensuality doesn't arise in him, and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned; the unarisen effluent of becoming doesn't arise in him, and the arisen effluent of becoming is abandoned; the unarisen effluent of ignorance doesn't arise in him, and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned. These are the ideas fit for attention that he doesn't attend to. Through his attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his not attending to ideas fit for attention, both unarisen effluents arise in him, and arisen effluents increase. \"This is how he attends inappropriately: 'Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past? Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?' Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present: 'Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?' \"As he attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds of view arises in him: The view I have a self arises in him as true & established, or the view I have no self ... or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self ... or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive not-self ... or the view It is precisely by means of not-self that I perceive self arises in him as true & established, or else he has a view like this: This very self of mine--the knower that is sensitive here & there to the ripening of good & bad actions--is the self of mine that is constant, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and will endure as long as eternity. This is called a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. Bound by a fetter of views, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is not freed from birth, aging, & death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair. He is not freed, I tell you, from suffering & stress. \"The well-instructed disciple of the noble ones--who has regard for noble ones, is well-versed & disciplined in their Dhamma; who has regard for people of integrity, is well-versed & disciplined in their Dhamma--discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention. This being so, he doesn't attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends (instead) to ideas fit for attention. \"And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he doesn't attend to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises in him, and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases; the unarisen effluent of becoming arises in him, and the arisen effluent of becoming increases; the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises in him, and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases. These are the ideas unfit for attention that he doesn't attend to. \"And what are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of sensuality doesn't arise in him, and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned; the unarisen effluent of becoming doesn't arise in him, and the arisen effluent of becoming is abandoned; the unarisen effluent of ignorance doesn't arise in him, and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned. These are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to. Through his not attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his attending to ideas fit for attention, unarisen effluents do not arise in him, and arisen effluents are abandoned. \"He attends appropriately, This is stress ... This is the origination of stress ... This is the cessation of stress ... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress. As he attends appropriately in this way, three fetters are abandoned in him: self-identification view, doubt, and grasping at habits & practices. These are called the effluents to be abandoned by seeing. \"[2] And what are the effluents to be abandoned by restraining? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, dwells restrained with the restraint of the eye-faculty. The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the eye-faculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the eye-faculty. \"Reflecting appropriately, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the ear-faculty .... \"Reflecting appropriately, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the nose-faculty .... \"Reflecting appropriately, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the tongue-faculty .... \"Reflecting appropriately, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the body-faculty .... \"Reflecting appropriately, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the intellect-faculty. The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the intellect-faculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the intellect-faculty. These are called the effluents to be abandoned by restraining. \"[3] And what are the effluents to be abandoned by using? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, uses the robe simply to counteract cold, to counteract heat, to counteract the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, & reptiles; simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that cause shame. \"Reflecting appropriately, he uses alms food, not playfully, nor for intoxication, nor for putting on bulk, nor for beautification; but simply for the survival & continuance of this body, for ending its afflictions, for the support of the holy life, thinking, 'Thus will I destroy old feelings (of hunger) and not create new feelings (from overeating). I will maintain myself, be blameless, & live in comfort.' \"Reflecting appropriately, he uses lodging simply to counteract cold, to counteract heat, to counteract the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, & reptiles; simply for protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusion. \"Reflecting appropriately, he uses medicinal requisites that are used for curing the sick simply to counteract any pains of illness that have arisen and for maximum freedom from disease. \"The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to use these things (in this way) do not arise for him when he uses them (in this way). These are called the effluents to be abandoned by using. \"[4] And what are the effluents to be abandoned by tolerating? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, endures. He tolerates cold, heat, hunger, & thirst; the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, & reptiles; ill-spoken, unwelcome words & bodily feelings that, when they arise, are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, disagreeable, displeasing, & menacing to life. The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to tolerate these things do not arise for him when he tolerates them. These are called the effluents to be abandoned by tolerating. \"[5] And what are the effluents to be abandoned by avoiding? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild bull, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, a bramble patch, a chasm, a cliff, a cesspool, an open sewer. Reflecting appropriately, he avoids sitting in the sorts of unsuitable seats, wandering to the sorts of unsuitable habitats, and associating with the sorts of bad friends that would make his observant companions in the holy life suspect him of evil conduct. The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to avoid these things do not arise for him when he avoids them. These are called the effluents to be abandoned by avoiding. \"[6] And what are the effluents to be abandoned by destroying? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, doesn't tolerate an arisen thought of sensuality. He abandons it, destroys it, dispels it, & wipes it out of existence. \"Reflecting appropriately, he doesn't tolerate an arisen thought of ill will... \"Reflecting appropriately, he doesn't tolerate an arisen thought of harmfulness... \"Reflecting appropriately, he doesn't tolerate arisen evil, unskillful qualities. He abandons them, destroys them, dispels them, & wipes them out of existence. The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to destroy these things do not arise for him when he destroys them. These are called the effluents to be abandoned by destroying. \"[7] And what are the effluents to be abandoned by developing? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening... persistence as a factor for awakening... rapture as a factor for awakening... calm as a factor for awakening... concentration as a factor for awakening... equanimity as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in letting go. The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to develop these qualities do not arise for him when he develops them. These are called the effluents to be abandoned by developing. \"When a monk's effluents that should be abandoned by seeing have been abandoned by seeing, his effluents that should be abandoned by restraining have been abandoned by restraining, his effluents that should be abandoned by using have been abandoned by using, his effluents that should be abandoned by tolerating have been abandoned by tolerating, his effluents that should be abandoned by avoiding have been abandoned by avoiding, his effluents that should be abandoned by destroying have been abandoned by destroying, his effluents that should be abandoned by developing have been abandoned by developing, then he is called a monk who dwells restrained with the restraint of all the effluents. He has severed craving, thrown off the fetters, and--through the right penetration of conceit--has made an end of suffering & stress.\" That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words. See also: MN 63; MN 72; SN 12:20; SN 22:122; SN 44:10; AN 4:42; AN 4:200; AN 10:93\n",

      "Title:  The Great Lionâs Roar Discourse\n",
      "Original Text:  I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali, outside of the city, in a forest grove to the west of the city. And on that occasion Sunakkhatta the Licchavi1 had recently left this Dhamma & Vinaya. He was making this statement in the Vesali assembly: \"Gotama the contemplative has no superior human state, no distinction in knowledge & vision worthy of a noble one. Having hammered it out through logic, Gotama the contemplative teaches a Dhamma that follows his reasoning, his own invention. And whenever his Dhamma is taught for anyone's sake, it leads those who act on it to the right ending of suffering & stress.\" Then, early in the morning, Ven. Sariputta adjusted his under robe and--carrying his bowl & robes--went into Vesali for alms. He heard Sunakkhatta the Licchavi making this statement in the Vesali assembly: \"Gotama the contemplative has no superior human state, no distinction in knowledge & vision worthy of a noble one. Having hammered it out through logic, Gotama the contemplative teaches a Dhamma that follows his reasoning, his own invention. And whenever his Dhamma is taught for anyone's sake, it leads those who act on it to the right ending of suffering & stress.\" Then Ven. Sariputta--having gone for alms in Vesali, after the meal, returning from his alms round--went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, \"Lord, Sunakkhatta the Licchavi has recently left this Dhamma & Vinaya. He is making this statement in the Vesali assembly: 'Gotama the contemplative has no superior human state, no distinction in knowledge & vision worthy of a noble one. Having hammered it out through logic, Gotama the contemplative teaches a Dhamma that follows his reasoning, his own invention. And whenever his Dhamma is taught for anyone's sake, it leads those who act on it to the right ending of suffering & stress.'\" \"Sariputta, this worthless man Sunakkhatta is angry. Out of anger, he has made this statement, (thinking,) 'I will speak in dispraise,' but actually he is speaking praise of the Tathagata. For it is in praise of the Tathagata when anyone says, 'And whenever his Dhamma is taught for anyone's sake, it leads those who act on it to the right ending of suffering & stress.' \"Sariputta, the righteous inference will never occur to this worthless man Sunakkhatta that 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy & rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing & conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas & human beings, awakened, blessed.' \"Sariputta, the righteous inference will never occur to this worthless man Sunakkhatta that 'Indeed, the Blessed One wields manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, & mountains as if through space. He dives in & out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches & strokes even the sun & moon, so mighty & powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.' \"Sariputta, the righteous inference will never occur to this worthless man Sunakkhatta that 'Indeed, the Blessed One hears--by means of the divine ear-element, purified & surpassing the human--both kinds of sounds: divine & human, whether near or far.' \"Sariputta, the righteous inference will never occur to this worthless man Sunakkhatta that 'Indeed, the Blessed One knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as \"a mind with passion,\" and a mind without passion as \"a mind without passion.\" He discerns a mind with aversion as \"a mind with aversion,\" and a mind without aversion as \"a mind without aversion.\" He discerns a mind with delusion as \"a mind with delusion,\" and a mind without delusion as \"a mind without delusion.\" He discerns a restricted mind as \"a restricted mind,\" and a scattered mind as \"a scattered mind.\" He discerns an enlarged mind2 as \"an enlarged mind,\" and an unenlarged mind as \"an unenlarged mind.\" He discerns a surpassed mind [one that is not at the most excellent level] as \"a surpassed mind,\" and an unsurpassed mind as \"an unsurpassed mind.\" He discerns a concentrated mind as \"a concentrated mind,\" and an unconcentrated mind as \"an unconcentrated mind.\" He discerns a released mind3 as \"a released mind,\" and an unreleased mind as \"an unreleased mind.\"' \"Sariputta, there are these ten Tathagata-strengths of the Tathagata, endowed with which the Tathagata makes known his status as the bull, roars his lion's roar in the assembly, and sets the Brahma-wheel4 in motion. Which ten? \"Here the Tathagata discerns, as they have come to be, the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible. That the Tathagata discerns, as they have come to be, the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible: This is a Tathagata-strength of the Tathagata, endowed with which the Tathagata makes known his status as the bull, roars his lion's roar in the assembly, and sets the Brahma-wheel in motion. \"Then again, the Tathagata discerns, as it has come to be, the ripening--in line with possibilities & causes--of actions undertaken, whether past, future, or present. ... \"Then again, the Tathagata discerns, as they have come to be, the paths of practice leading to every destination. ... \"Then again, the Tathagata discerns, as it has come to be, the cosmos with its many properties, its diverse properties. ... \"Then again, the Tathagata discerns, as they have come to be, the diverse inclinations of beings. ... \"Then again, the Tathagata discerns, as it has come to be, the (higher or lower) development of the faculties of other beings, other individuals. ... \"Then again, the Tathagata discerns, as they have come to be, the defilement, purification, & arising out of the attainments of jhana, the emancipations5, & concentration. ... \"Then again, the Tathagata recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two... five, ten... fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, many eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of cosmic expansion, many eons of cosmic contraction & expansion: 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure & pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure & pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes & details. ... \"Then again, the Tathagata sees--by means of the divine eye, purified & surpassing the human--beings passing away & re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior & superior, beautiful & ugly, fortunate & unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings--who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech & mind, who reviled noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views--with the breakup of the body, after death, have reappeared in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell. But these beings--who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, & mind, who did not revile noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views--with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a good destination, a heavenly world.' Thus--by means of the divine eye, purified & surpassing the human--he sees beings passing away & re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior & superior, beautiful & ugly, fortunate & unfortunate in accordance with their kamma. ... \"Then again, the Tathagata--with the ending of effluents--remains in the effluent-free awareness-release & discernment-release, having directly known & realized them for himself right in the here-&-now. That the Tathagata--with the ending of effluents--remains in the effluent-free awareness-release & discernment-release, having directly known & realized them for himself right in the here-&-now: This, too, is a Tathagata-strength of the Tathagata, endowed with which the Tathagata makes known his status as the bull, roars his lion's roar in the assembly, and sets the Brahma-wheel in motion. \"Sariputta, these are the ten Tathagata-strengths of the Tathagata, endowed with which the Tathagata makes known his status as the bull, roars his lion's roar in the assembly, and sets the Brahma-wheel in motion. \"Sariputta, when I know this & see this, anyone who would say of me, 'Gotama the contemplative has no superior human state, no distinction in knowledge & vision worthy of a noble one. Having hammered it out through logic, Gotama the contemplative teaches a Dhamma that follows his reasoning, his own invention': If he doesn't abandon that statement, doesn't abandon that intent, doesn't relinquish that view, then as if he were to be carried off, he would for that very reason be placed in hell. Just as a monk consummate in virtue, consummate in concentration, consummate in discernment would attain gnosis in the here-&-now and for that very reason be complete in that, I tell you; (in the same way,) if that person doesn't abandon that statement, doesn't abandon that intent, doesn't relinquish that view, then as if he were to be carried off, he would for that very reason be placed in hell. \"Sariputta, the Tathagata has these four reasons for being undaunted, endowed with which he makes known his status as the bull, roars his lion's roar in the assembly, and sets the Brahma-wheel in motion. Which four? \"I can envision no sign by which any contemplative or brahman or deva or Mara or Brahma or anyone else in the cosmos could, in line with the Dhamma, accuse me thus: 'Although you claim to be rightly self-awakened, you have not awakened to these dhammas.' Envisioning no such sign, I dwell in security, fearless & undaunted. \"I can envision no sign by which any contemplative or brahman ... or anyone else in the cosmos could, in line with the Dhamma, accuse me thus: 'Although you claim to have ended the effluents, there are these effluents that you have not ended.'

I was rough, the most extreme in roughness. I was scrupulous, the most extreme in scrupulousness. I was secluded, the most extreme in seclusion. \"This is how it was for me in terms of asceticism: I was cloth-less, rejecting conventions, licking my hands, not coming when called, not staying when asked. I didn't consent to food brought to me, to food dedicated to me, or to an invitation to a meal. I accepted nothing from the mouth of a pot or from the mouth of a bowl. I accepted nothing from across a threshold, across a stick, across a pestle, from two eating together, from a pregnant woman, from a nursing woman, from a woman living with a man, from where it was announced that food was to be distributed, from where a dog was waiting or flies were buzzing. I took no fish or meat. I drank no liquor, wine, or fermented drink. \"I limited myself to one house & one morsel (a day), or two houses & two morsels... seven houses & seven morsels. I lived on one saucerful (a day), two... seven saucerfuls a day. I took food once a day, once every two days... once every seven days, and so on up to a fortnight, devoted to regulating my intake of food. \"I was an eater of greens, millet, wild rice, hide-parings, moss, rice bran, rice-scum, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. I lived on forest roots & berries. I fed on fallen fruits. \"I wore hemp, canvas, shrouds, refuse rags, tree bark, antelope hide, strips of antelope hide, kusa-grass garments, bark garments, wood-shaving garments, head-hair garments, animal wool, owl's wings. I was a hair-&-beard puller, one devoted to the practice of pulling out my hair & beard. I was a stander, one who rejected seats. I was a kneeler, one devoted to the exertion of kneeling. I was a spike-mattresser, one who made my bed on a bed of spikes. I was a third-time-in-the-evening bather, one who stayed devoted to the practice of bathing in water. \"Thus in a variety of ways I stayed devoted to the practice of tormenting & torturing the body. That's how it was for me in terms of asceticism. \"This is how it was for me in terms of roughness: Many years worth of dirt had collected on my body so that it became a crust. Just like a tinduka stump, having collected (dirt) for many years so that it has become a crust--in the same way, many years worth of dirt had collected on my body so that it became a crust. \"The thought didn't occur to me, 'Oh! I would like to rub off this dirt with my hand! Or may others rub off this dirt with their hands!' That didn't occur to me. \"That's how it was for me in terms of roughness. \"This is how it was for me in terms of scrupulousness: I was mindful stepping forward; I was mindful stepping back. Even for a drop of water, concern was established within me, (thinking,) 'I won't engage in killing these small, unfortunate creatures.' \"That's how it was for me in terms of scrupulousness. \"This is how it was for me in terms of seclusion: Plunging into a certain wilderness area, I stayed there. When I saw a cowherd, an ox-herd, a grass-carrier, a wood-carrier, or a woodsman, I fled from grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from hill to hill, from meadow to meadow. Why was that? (I thought,) 'May they not see me, and may I not see them.' \"Just like a wild deer, on seeing human beings, flees from grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from hill to hill, from meadow to meadow--in the same way, when I saw a cowherd, an ox-herd, a grass-carrier, a wood-carrier, or a woodsman, I fled from grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from hill to hill, from meadow to meadow. Why was that? (I thought,) 'May they not see me, and may I not see them.' \"That's how it was for me in terms of seclusion. \"I would crawl on all fours to the cow-sheds when the cows had gone out and the cowherds had gone off. Whatever manure there was from young nursing calves, I took just that for food. As long as my own urine and excrement hadn't run out, I took just my own urine and excrement for food. That's how it was for me in terms of subsisting on the great foul things as food. \"Plunging into a certain awe-inspiring forest grove, I stayed there. There, Sariputta, that awe-inspiring grove had this quality in terms of making one awe-inspired: When anyone who had not gone beyond passion entered, his hair would usually stand on end. \"Those cold winter nights of the between-the-eights, the time of snowfall: On nights like that I would stay in the open by night and in the grove by day. In the last month of the hot season, I would stay in the open by day and in the grove by night. And then this verse of amazement--never heard before--occurred to me: \"'He is scorched, he is drenched, alone-- alone in the awe-inspiring forest, naked, not sitting near a fire, the sage exerting himself in the search.' \"I arranged a sleeping place in a charnel ground, piling up bones from the corpses. \"And then cowherd boys, coming up to me, would spit on me, or urinate on me, or throw dirt on me, or stick twigs into my ears. But I do not remember giving rise to any evil thoughts toward them. \"That's how it was for me in terms of dwelling in equanimity. \"Sariputta, there are some contemplatives & brahmans with this doctrine, this view: 'Purity is by means of food.' \"'We live on jujube fruits,' they say. They eat jujubes, they eat jujube powder, they drink jujube juice, and make use of diverse products of the jujube. \"But I remember being one who ate just one jujube (per day). If the thought should occur to you, 'Maybe jujubes were large at that time,' it shouldn't be seen that way. Jujubes were just the same size then as they are now. \"For me, eating just one jujube (per day), my body became extremely emaciated. Simply from my eating so little, my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems. ... My backside became like a camel's hoof.... My spine stood out like a string of beads.... My ribs jutted out like the jutting rafters of an old, run-down barn.... The gleam of my eyes appeared to be sunk deep in my eye sockets like the gleam of water deep in a well.... My scalp shriveled & withered like a green bitter gourd, shriveled & withered in the heat & the wind.... The skin of my belly became so stuck to my spine that when I thought of touching my belly, I grabbed hold of my spine as well; and when I thought of touching my spine, I grabbed hold of the skin of my belly as well.... If I urinated or defecated, I fell over on my face right there.... If I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair--rotted at its roots--fell from my body as I rubbed, simply from eating so little.8 \"Sariputta, there are some contemplatives & brahmans with this doctrine, this view: 'Purity is by means of food.' \"'We live on green gram... sesame seeds ... rice ...,' they say. They eat rice, they eat rice powder, they drink rice water, and make use of diverse products of rice. \"But I remember being one who ate just one grain of rice (per day). If the thought should occur to you, 'Maybe rice grains were large at that time,' it shouldn't be seen that way. Rice grains were just the same size then as they are now. \"For me, eating just one grain of rice (per day), my body became extremely emaciated. Simply from my eating so little, my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems. ... \"But with this racking practice of austerities I didn't attain any superior human state, any distinction in knowledge or vision worthy of the noble ones. Why is that? Because of the non-attainment of this noble discernment--the noble discernment that, when attained, is noble, leading out, leading those who act on it to the right ending of suffering & stress. \"There are some contemplatives & brahmans with this doctrine, this view: 'Purity is by means of wandering on.'9 But it's not easy to find a wandering-on that I haven't wandered to before, in this long, long journey, aside from the Pure-Abode devas. If I had wandered among the Pure-Abode devas, I wouldn't have come back to this world again. \"There are some contemplatives & brahmans with this doctrine, this view: 'Purity is by means of rebirth.' But it's not easy to find a rebirth that I haven't been reborn in before, in this long, long journey, aside from the Pure-Abode devas. If I had been reborn among the Pure-Abode devas, I wouldn't have come back to this world again. \"There are some contemplatives & brahmans with this doctrine, this view: 'Purity is by means of abodes.' But it's not easy to find an abode in which I haven't abided before, in this long, long journey, aside from the Pure-Abode devas. If I had abided among the Pure-Abode devas, I wouldn't have come back to this world again. \"There are some contemplatives & brahmans with this doctrine, this view: 'Purity is by means of sacrifice.' But it's not easy to find a sacrifice that I haven't performed before, in this long, long journey, either as a head-anointed noble-warrior king or as an extremely wealthy brahman. \"There are some contemplatives & brahmans with this doctrine, this view: 'Purity is by means of tending the (sacred) fire.' But it's not easy to find a (sacred) fire that I haven't tended to before, in this long, long journey, either as a head-anointed noble-warrior king or as an extremely wealthy brahman. \"There are some contemplatives & brahmans with this doctrine, this view: 'As long as this good man is young, youthful, with fully black hair, endowed with the blessing of youth & the first stage of life, he is endowed with the foremost keenness of discernment. But when this good man becomes aged, old, elderly, advanced in years, having come to the last stage of life, 80 years old, 90 years old, or 100 years old in this birth, then because of that, his keenness of discernment diminishes. Sariputta, it shouldn't be seen that way. \"At this time, I am aged, old, elderly, advanced in years, having come to the last stage of life. My age has come to 80 years. \"Sariputta, suppose that I had four disciples with a 100-year life span, living for 100 years, and endowed with excellent mindfulness, retention, recall, & keenness of discernment. Just as an archer with a good bow--trained, dexterous, & practiced--could easily shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palmyra tree, they--endowed with that great an extent of mindfulness, that great an extent of retention, that great an extent of recall, & that keenness of discernment--would ask me one question after another on the four establishings of mindfulness. And I, asked again & again, would answer. Answered, they would remember what I had answered, and they wouldn't counter-question me about it a second time. Aside from eating, drinking, chewing, & savoring, aside from urinating & defecating, aside from relieving sleepiness & weariness, there would be no ending of the Tathagata's Dhamma teaching, there would be no ending of the Tathagata's phrasing of Dhamma statements, there would be no ending of the Tathagata's quick-wittedness (in answering) questions; but those four disciples of mine, with their 100-year life span, living for 100 years, would die with the passing of 100 years.10 \"Even if you carried me around on a bed, there would be no alteration in the Tathagata's keenness of discernment. \"If, when speaking rightly, one were to say of someone, 'A being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the benefit & happiness of many, out of sympathy for the world, for the welfare, benefit, & happiness of devas & human beings,' he would rightly be speaking of me.\" Now, on that occasion Ven. Nagasamala11 was standing behind the Blessed One, fanning him. Then he said to the Blessed One, \"How amazing, lord! How astounding! How on hearing this Dhamma-explanation my hair stands on end! What, lord, is the name of this Dhamma-explanation?\" \"Nagasamala, because of that, remember this Dhamma-explanation as the 'Hair-raising Sequence.'\" That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. Nagasamala delighted in the Blessed One's words. Notes 1. See MN 105. 2. Mahaggatam. This term is used, together with \"immeasurable / unlimited,\" in the standard description of the awareness generated in the practice of the brahmaviharas (SN 42:8). According to Ven. Anuruddha in MN 127, however, an enlarged mind is not immeasurable. Its range of awareness is larger than the body but still measurable, ranging in distance from the shade of a tree to the earth bounded by the ocean. 3. On the various levels of release, see DN 15, MN 43, and AN 9:43-45. 4. The Dhamma wheel. See SN 56:11. This expression also appears in Iti 112. 5. On the eight emancipations, see DN 15. 6. For more on the Buddha's engagement with the eight assemblies, see DN 16. 7. Ekayana magga. This term also appears in MN 10 and DN 22, where the four establishings of mindfulness are said to be an ekayana magga. For decades, this term was translated as \"the only way,\" but more recently--beginning with Ven. Nanamoli--translators have noted that the phrase ekayana magga appears in this series of similes where it reveals its idiomatic sense. For the similes to work, ekayana magga requires the sense, not of an only way, but of a way that goes to only one destination. In other words, an ekayana magga is a path that doesn't fork--one that, as long as you follow it, takes you to a single, inevitable goal. 8. This description of the bodhisatta's extreme emaciation is identical with the description of his extreme emaciation that resulted from engaging in austerities in his last lifetime. See MN 36. 9. This is the teaching of Makkhali Gosala. See DN 2. 10. For a discussion of the implications of this passage for an understanding of the establishings of mindfulness, see Right Mindfulness, Chapter 8. 11. See Ud 8:7.

      "Original Text:  This discourse is one of the masterpieces of the Pali Canon. At heart, it is a comprehensive portrait of the Buddhist path of training, illustrating each stage of the training with vivid similes. This portrait is placed in juxtaposition to the Buddhist view of the teachings of rival philosophical teachers of the time, showing how the Buddha--in contradistinction to the inflexible, party-line approach of his contemporaries--presented his teaching in a way that was pertinent and sensitive to the needs of his listeners. This larger portrait of the intellectual landscape of early Buddhist India is then presented in a moving narrative frame: the sad story of King Ajatasattu. Ajatasattu was the son of King Bimbisara of Magadha, one of the Buddha's earliest followers. Urged on by Devadatta--the Buddha's cousin, who wished to use Ajatasattu's support in his bid to take over the Buddha's position as head of the Sangha--Ajatasattu arranged for his father's death so that he could secure his own position on the throne. As a result of this evil deed, he was destined not only to be killed by his own son--Udayabhadda (mentioned in the discourse)--but also to take immediate rebirth in one of the lowest regions of hell. In this discourse, Ajatasattu visits the Buddha in hopes that the latter will bring some peace to his mind. The question he puts to the Buddha shows the limited level of his own understanding, so the Buddha patiently describes the steps of the training, beginning at a very basic level and gradually moving up, as a way of raising the king's spiritual horizons. At the end of the talk, Ajatasattu takes refuge in the Triple Gem. Although his earlier deeds were so heavy that this expression of faith could have only limited consequences in the immediate present, the Commentary assures us that the king's story would ultimately have a happy ending. After the Buddha's death, he sponsored the First Council, at which a congress of arahant disciples produced the first standardized account of the Buddha's teachings. As a result of the merit coming from this deed, Ajatasattu is destined--after his release from hell--to attain awakening as a Private Buddha. * * * I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Rajagaha, in Jivaka Komarabhacca's mango grove, with a large Sangha of monks--1,250 monks in all. Now at that time--it being the uposatha day, the full-moon night of the water-lily season, the fourth month of the rains--King Ajatasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Vedehi, was sitting on the roof terrace of his palace surrounded by his ministers. Then he felt inspired to exclaim: \"How wonderful is this moonlit night! How beautiful... How lovely... How inspiring... How auspicious is this moonlit night! What contemplative or brahman should we visit tonight who, on being visited, would make our mind clear & serene?\" When this was said, one of the ministers said to the king: \"Your majesty, there is Purana Kassapa, the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, honored and famous, esteemed as holy by the mass of people. He is aged, long gone forth, advanced in years, in the last phase of life. Your majesty should visit him. Perhaps, if visited by you, he would make your mind clear & serene.\" When this was said, the king remained silent. Then another minister said to the king: \"Your majesty, there is Makkhali Gosala... \" ... \"Your majesty, there is Ajita Kesakambalin... \" ... \"Your majesty, there is Pakudha Kaccayana... \" ... \"Your majesty, there is Sanjaya Velatthaputta... \" ... \"Your majesty, there is Nigantha Nataputta, the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, honored and famous, esteemed as holy by the mass of people. He is aged, long gone forth, advanced in years, in the last phase of life. Your majesty should visit him. Perhaps, if visited by you, he would make your mind clear & serene.\" When this was said, the king remained silent. All this time Jivaka Komarabhacca was sitting silently not far from the king. So the king said to him, \"Friend Jivaka, why are you silent?\" \"Your majesty, there is the Blessed One, worthy and rightly self-awakened, staying in my mango grove with a large Sangha of monks--1,250 monks in all. Concerning this Blessed One, this admirable report has been spread: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy & rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing & conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas & human beings, awakened, blessed.' Your majesty should visit him. Perhaps, if visited by you, he would make your mind clear & serene.\" \"Then in that case, friend Jivaka, have the riding elephants prepared.\" Responding, \"As you say, your majesty,\" having had five hundred female elephants prepared as well as the king's personal tusker, Jivaka announced to the king: \"Your majesty, your riding elephants are prepared. Do what you think it is now time to do.\" Then the king, having had five hundred of his women mounted on the five hundred female elephants--one on each--and having mounted his own personal tusker, set out from the capital in full royal state, with attendants carrying torches, headed for Jivaka Komarabhacca's mango grove. But when the king was not far from the mango grove, he was gripped with fear, trepidation, his hair standing on end. Fearful, agitated, his hair standing on end, he said to Jivaka Komarabhacca: \"Friend Jivaka, you aren't deceiving me, are you? You aren't betraying me, are you? You aren't turning me over to my enemies, are you? How can there be such a large Sangha of monks--1,250 in all--with no sound of sneezing, no sound of coughing, no voices at all?\" \"Don't be afraid, great king. Don't be afraid. I'm not deceiving you or betraying you or turning you over to your enemies. Go forward, great king, go forward! Those are lamps burning in the pavilion hall.\" Then the king, going as far on his tusker as the ground would permit, dismounted and approached the door of the pavilion hall on foot. On arrival, he asked Jivaka: \"Where, friend Jivaka, is the Blessed One?\" \"That is the Blessed One, great king, sitting against the middle pillar, facing east, surrounded by the Sangha of monks.\" Then the king approached the Blessed One and, on reaching him, stood to one side. As he was standing there--surveying the Sangha of monks sitting in absolute silence, utterly clear & serene like a lake--he felt inspired to exclaim: \"May my son, Prince Udayabhadda, enjoy the same stillness that this Sangha of monks now enjoys!\" (The Blessed One said:) \"Have you come, great king, together with your affections?\" \"Lord, my son, Prince Udayabhadda, is very dear to me. May he enjoy the same stillness that this Sangha of monks now enjoys!\" Then, bowing down to the Blessed One and saluting the Sangha of monks with his hands palm-to-palm over his heart, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: \"I would like to ask the Blessed One about a certain issue, if he would give me the opportunity to explain my question.\" \"Ask, great king, whatever you like.\" \"Lord, there are these common craftsmen: elephant-trainers, horse-trainers, charioteers, archers, standard bearers, camp marshals, supply corps officers, high royal officers, commandos, military heroes, armor-clad warriors, leather-clad warriors, domestic slaves, confectioners, barbers, bath attendants, cooks, garland-makers, laundrymen, weavers, basket-makers, potters, calculators, accountants, and any other craftsmen of a similar sort. They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here & now. They give happiness & pleasure to themselves, to their parents, wives, & children, to their friends & colleagues. They put in place an excellent presentation of offerings to contemplatives & brahmans, leading to heaven, resulting in happiness, conducive to a heavenly rebirth. Is it possible, lord, to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here & now?\" \"Do you remember, great king, ever having asked this question of other contemplatives & brahmans?\" \"Yes, I do.\" \"If it isn't troublesome for you, how did they answer?\" \"No, it's not troublesome for me wherever the Blessed One--or someone like the Blessed One--is sitting.\" \"Then speak, great king.\" \"Once, lord, I approached Purana Kassapa and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, I sat to one side. As I was sitting there I asked him: 'Venerable Kassapa, there are these common craftsmen.... They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here & now.... Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here & now?' \"When this was said, Purana Kassapa said to me, 'Great king, in acting or getting others to act, in mutilating or getting others to mutilate, in torturing or getting others to torture, in inflicting sorrow or in getting others to inflict sorrow, in tormenting or getting others to torment, in intimidating or getting others to intimidate, in taking life, taking what is not given, breaking into houses, plundering wealth, committing burglary, ambushing highways, committing adultery, speaking falsehood--one does no evil. If with a razor-edged disk one were to turn all the living beings on this earth to a single heap of flesh, a single pile of flesh, there would be no evil from that cause, no coming of evil. Even if one were to go along the right bank of the Ganges, killing and getting others to kill, mutilating and getting others to mutilate, torturing and getting others to torture, there would be no evil from that cause, no coming of evil. Even if one were to go along the left bank of the Ganges, giving and getting others to give, making sacrifices and getting others to make sacrifices, there would be no merit from that cause, no coming of merit. Through generosity, self-control, restraint, and truthful speech there is no merit from that cause, no coming of merit.' \"Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, Purana Kassapa answered with non-action. Just as if a person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a breadfruit, were to answer with a mango: In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, Purana Kassapa answered with non-action. The thought occurred to me: 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a contemplative or brahman living in his realm?' Yet I neither delighted in Purana Kassapa's words nor did I protest against them. Neither delighting nor protesting, I was dissatisfied. Without expressing dissatisfaction, without accepting his teaching, without adopting it, I got up from my seat and left. \"Another time I approached Makkhali Gosala and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, I sat to one side. As I was sitting there I asked him: 'Venerable Gosala, there are these common craftsmen.... They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here & now.... Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here & now?' \"When this was said, Makkhali Gosala said to me, 'Great king, there is no cause, no requisite condition, for the defilement of beings. Beings are defiled without cause, without requisite condition. There is no cause, no requisite condition, for the purification of beings. Beings are purified without cause, without requisite condition. There is nothing self-caused, nothing other-caused, nothing human-caused. There is no strength, no effort, no human energy, no human endeavor. All living beings, all life, all beings, all souls are powerless, devoid of strength, devoid of effort. Subject to the changes of fate, serendipity, and nature, they are sensitive to pleasure and pain in the six great classes of birth. \"'There are 1,406,600 principle modes of origin. There are 500 kinds of kamma, five kinds, and three kinds; full kamma and half kamma. There are 62 pathways, 62 sub-eons, six great classes of birth, eight classes of men, 4,900 modes of livelihood, 4,900 kinds of wanderers, 4,900 Naga-abodes, 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, 36 dust-realms, seven spheres of percipient beings, seven spheres of non-percipient beings, seven kinds of jointed plants, seven kinds of deities, seven kinds of human beings, seven kinds of demons, seven great lakes, seven major knots, seven minor knots, 700 major precipices, 700 minor precipices, 700 major dreams, 700 minor dreams, 84,000 great aeons. Having transmigrated and wandered on through these, the wise & the foolish alike will put an end to pain. \"'Though one might think, \"Through this morality, this practice, this austerity, or this holy life I will ripen unripened kamma and eliminate ripened kamma whenever touched by it\"--that is impossible. Pleasure and pain are measured out, the wandering-on is fixed in its limits. There is no shortening or lengthening, no accelerating or decelerating. Just as a ball of string, when thrown, comes to its end simply by unwinding, in the same way, having transmigrated and wandered on, the wise & the foolish alike will put an end to pain.' \"Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, Makkhali Gosala answered with purification through wandering-on. Just as if a person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a breadfruit, were to answer with a mango. In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, Makkhali Gosala answered with purification through wandering-on.

After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, I sat to one side. As I was sitting there I asked him: 'Venerable Ajita, there are these common craftsmen.... They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here & now.... Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here & now?' \"When this was said, Ajita Kesakambalin said to me, 'Great king, there is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed. There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions. There is no this world, no next world, no mother, no father, no spontaneously reborn beings; no contemplatives or brahmans who, faring rightly and practicing rightly, proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves. A person is a composite of four primary elements. At death, the earth (in the body) returns to and merges with the (external) earth-substance. The fire returns to and merges with the external fire-substance. The liquid returns to and merges with the external liquid-substance. The wind returns to and merges with the external wind-substance. The sense-faculties scatter into space. Four men, with the bier as the fifth, carry the corpse. Its eulogies are sounded only as far as the charnel ground. The bones turn pigeon-colored. The offerings end in ashes. Generosity is taught by idiots. The words of those who speak of existence after death are false, empty chatter. With the break-up of the body, the wise and the foolish alike are annihilated, destroyed. They do not exist after death.' \"Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, Ajita Kesakambalin answered with annihilation. Just as if a person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a breadfruit, were to answer with a mango. In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, Ajita Kesakambalin answered with annihilation.

They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here & now.... Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here & now?' \"When this was said, Pakudha Kaccayana said to me, 'Great king, there are these seven substances--unmade, irreducible, uncreated, without a creator, barren, stable as a mountain-peak, standing firm like a pillar--that do not alter, do not change, do not interfere with one another, are incapable of causing one another pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain. Which seven? The earth-substance, the liquid-substance, the fire-substance, the wind-substance, pleasure, pain, and the soul as the seventh. These are the seven substances--unmade, irreducible, uncreated, without a creator, barren, stable as a mountain-peak, standing firm like a pillar--that do not alter, do not change, do not interfere with one another, and are incapable of causing one another pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain. \"'And among them there is no killer nor one who causes killing, no hearer nor one who causes hearing, no cognizer nor one who causes cognition.

And how is the Nigantha restrained with the fourfold restraint? There is the case where the Nigantha is obstructed by all waters, conjoined with all waters, cleansed with all waters, suffused with all waters. This is how the Nigantha is restrained with the fourfold restraint. When the Nigantha--a knotless one--is restrained with such a fourfold restraint, he is said to be a Knotless One [Nigantha], a son of Nata [Nataputta], with his self perfected, his self controlled, his self established.' \"Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, Nigantha Nataputta answered with fourfold restraint.

Answer as you see fit. Suppose there were a man of yours: your slave, your workman, rising in the morning before you, going to bed in the evening only after you, doing whatever you order, always acting to please you, speaking politely to you, always watching for the look on your face.

Would you, thus informed, say, 'Bring that man back to me. Make him again be my slave, my workman... always watching for the look on my face!'?\" \"Not at all, lord. Rather, I am the one who should bow down to him, rise up out of respect for him, invite him to a seat, invite him to accept gifts of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick.

With that being the case, is there a visible fruit of the contemplative life, or is there not?\" \"Yes, lord. With that being the case, there certainly is a visible fruit of the contemplative life.\" \"This, great king, is the first fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here & now, that I point out to you.\" \"But is it possible, lord, to point out yet another fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here & now?\" \"Yes, it is, great king.

On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at any theme or details by which--if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye--evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. On hearing a sound with the ear.... On smelling an aroma with the nose.... On tasting a flavor with the tongue.... On touching a tactile sensation with the body.... On cognizing an idea with the intellect, he does not grasp at any theme or details by which--if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect--evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. Endowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties, he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless. This is how a monk guards the doors of his senses. \"And how is a monk possessed of mindfulness & alertness? When going forward & returning, he makes himself alert. When looking toward & looking away.... when bending & extending his limbs.... when carrying his outer cloak, his upper robe, & his bowl.... when eating, drinking, chewing, & tasting.... when urinating & defecating.... when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, & remaining silent, he makes himself alert. This is how a monk is possessed of mindfulness & alertness. \"And how is a monk content? Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden; so too is he content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hunger. Wherever he goes, he takes only his barest necessities along. This is how a monk is content. \"Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue, this noble restraint over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness and alertness, and this noble contentment, he seeks out a secluded dwelling: a wilderness, the shade of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a forest grove, the open air, a heap of straw. After his meal, returning from his alms round, he sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body erect, and brings mindfulness to the fore. \"Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness. He cleanses his mind of covetousness. Abandoning ill will & anger, he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will, sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings. He cleanses his mind of ill will & anger. Abandoning sloth & drowsiness, he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth & drowsiness, mindful, alert, percipient of light. He cleanses his mind of sloth & drowsiness. Abandoning restlessness & anxiety, he dwells undisturbed, his mind inwardly stilled. He cleanses his mind of restlessness & anxiety.

He repays his old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining his wife. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, taking a loan, I invested it in my business affairs. Now my business affairs have succeeded. I have repaid my old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining my wife.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness. \"Now suppose that a man falls sick--in pain and seriously ill. He does not enjoy his meals, and there is no strength in his body. As time passes, he eventually recovers from that sickness. He enjoys his meals and there is strength in his body. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was sick.... Now I am recovered from that sickness. I enjoy my meals and there is strength in my body.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness. \"Now suppose that a man is bound in prison. As time passes, he eventually is released from that bondage, safe and sound, with no loss of property. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was bound in prison. Now I am released from that bondage, safe and sound, with no loss of my property.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness. \"Now suppose that a man is a slave, subject to others, not subject to himself, unable to go where he likes. As time passes, he eventually is released from that slavery, subject to himself, not subject to others, freed, able to go where he likes. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was a slave.... Now I am released from that slavery, subject to myself, not subject to others, freed, able to go where I like.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness. \"Now suppose that a man, carrying money and goods, is traveling by a road through desolate country. As time passes, he eventually emerges from that desolate country, safe and sound, with no loss of property. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, carrying money and goods, I was traveling by a road through desolate country. Now I have emerged from that desolate country, safe and sound, with no loss of my property.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness. \"In the same way, when these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself, the monk regards it as a debt, a sickness, a prison, slavery, a road through desolate country. But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself, he regards it as unindebtedness, good health, release from prison, freedom, a place of security. When he sees that they have been abandoned within him, gladness is born. In one who is gladdened, rapture is born. Enraptured at heart, his body grows calm. His body calm, he is sensitive to pleasure. Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated. \"Quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation. He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture & pleasure born of seclusion. Just as if a dexterous bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again and again with water, so that his ball of bath powder--saturated, moisture-laden, permeated within and without--would nevertheless not drip; even so, the monk permeates...this very body with the rapture & pleasure born of seclusion. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture & pleasure born of seclusion. This is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime. \"Then, with the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters and remains in the second jhana: rapture & pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation--internal assurance. He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture & pleasure born of concentration. Just like a lake with spring-water welling up from within, having no inflow from the east, west, north, or south, and with the skies supplying abundant showers time and again,1 so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate and pervade, suffuse and fill it with cool waters, there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture & pleasure born of concentration. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture & pleasure born of concentration. This, too, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime. \"And then, with the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters and remains in the third jhana, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. Just as in a lotus pond, some of the lotuses, born and growing in the water, stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water, so that they are permeated and pervaded, suffused and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips, and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture. This, too, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime. \"And then, with the abandoning of pleasure & pain--as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress--he enters and remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. He sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness. This, too, great king, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime. \"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother and father, nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, and dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here.' Just as if there were a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water--eight faceted, well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects, and going through the middle of it was a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread--and a man with good eyesight, taking it in his hand, were to reflect on it thus: 'This is a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water, eight faceted, well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects. And this, going through the middle of it, is a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.' In the same way--with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability--the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother and father, nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, and dispersion.

From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. Just as if a man were to draw a reed from its sheath. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sheath, this is the reed. The sheath is one thing, the reed another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.' Or as if a man were to draw a sword from its scabbard. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.' Or as if a man were to pull a snake out from its slough. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake is one thing, the slough another, but the snake has been pulled out from the slough.' In the same way--with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. This, too, great king, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime. \"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers. He wields manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. Just as a dexterous potter or his assistant could craft from well-prepared clay whatever kind of pottery vessel he likes, or as a dexterous ivory-carver or his assistant could craft from well-prepared ivory any kind of ivory-work he likes, or as a dexterous goldsmith or his assistant could craft from well-prepared gold any kind of gold article he likes; in the same way--with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability--the monk directs and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers.... He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. This, too, great king, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime. \"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element. He hears--by means of the divine ear-element, purified and surpassing the human--both kinds of sounds: divine and human, whether near or far. Just as if a man traveling along a highway were to hear the sounds of kettledrums, small drums, conchs, cymbals, and tom-toms. He would know, 'That is the sound of kettledrums, that is the sound of small drums, that is the sound of conchs, that is the sound of cymbals, and that is the sound of tom-toms.' In the same way--with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability--the monk directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element.

He discerns the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as 'a mind with passion,' and a mind without passion as 'a mind without passion.' He discerns a mind with aversion as 'a mind with aversion,' and a mind without aversion as 'a mind without aversion.' He discerns a mind with delusion as 'a mind with delusion,' and a mind without delusion as 'a mind without delusion.' He discerns a restricted mind as 'a restricted mind,' and a scattered mind as 'a scattered mind.' He discerns an enlarged mind2 as 'an enlarged mind,' and an unenlarged mind as 'an unenlarged mind.' He discerns a surpassed mind [one that is not at the most excellent level] as 'a surpassed mind,' and an unsurpassed mind as 'an unsurpassed mind.' He discerns a concentrated mind as 'a concentrated mind,' and an unconcentrated mind as 'an unconcentrated mind.' He discerns a released mind3 as 'a released mind,' and an unreleased mind as 'an unreleased mind.' Just as if a young woman--or man--fond of ornaments, examining the reflection of her own face in a bright mirror or a bowl of clear water would know 'blemished' if it were blemished, or 'unblemished' if it were not. In the same way--with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability--the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other beings. He discerns the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as 'a mind with passion,' and a mind without passion as 'a mind without passion' ... a released mind as 'a released mind,' and an unreleased mind as 'an unreleased mind.' This, too, great king, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime. \"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives [lit: previous homes]. He recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand, many eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of cosmic expansion, many eons of cosmic contraction & expansion, (recollecting,) 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure & pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure & pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes & details. Just as if a man were to go from his home village to another village, and then from that village to yet another village, and then from that village back to his home village. The thought would occur to him, 'I went from my home village to that village over there. There I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I went to that village over there, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I came back home.' In the same way--with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability--the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives... in their modes & details. This, too, great king, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime. \"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and re-appearance of beings. He sees--by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human--beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings--who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views--with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell. But these beings--who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views--with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a good destination, a heavenly world.' Thus--by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human--he sees beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma. Just as if there were a tall building in the central square (of a town), and a man with good eyesight standing on top of it were to see people entering a house, leaving it, walking along the street, and sitting in the central square. The thought would occur to him, 'These people are entering a house, leaving it, walking along the streets, and sitting in the central square.'

This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are effluents... This is the origination of effluents... This is the cessation of effluents... This is the way leading to the cessation of effluents.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the effluent of sensuality, the effluent of becoming, the effluent of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.' Just as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen--clear, limpid, & unsullied--where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting, and it would occur to him, 'This pool of water is clear, limpid, and unsullied.

This, too, great king, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here & now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime. And as for another visible fruit of the contemplative life, higher and more sublime than this, there is none.\" When this was said, King Ajatasattu said to the Blessed One: \"Magnificent, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One--through many lines of reasoning--made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life. \"A transgression has overcome me, lord, in that I was so foolish, so muddle-headed, and so unskilled as to kill my father--a righteous man, a righteous king--for the sake of sovereign rulership. May the Blessed One please accept this confession of my transgression as such, so that I may restrain myself in the future.\" \"Yes, great king, a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish, so muddle-headed, and so unskilled as to kill your father--a righteous man, a righteous king--for the sake of sovereign rulership. But because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma, we accept your confession. For it is a cause of growth in the discipline of the noble ones when, seeing a transgression as such, one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the future.\" When this was said, King Ajatasattu said to the Blessed One: \"Well, then, lord, I am now taking leave. Many are my duties, many my responsibilities.\" \"Then do, great king, what you think it is now time to do.\" So King Ajatasattu, delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, bowed down to him, and--after circumambulating him--left. Not long after King Ajatasattu had left, the Blessed One addressed the monks: \"The king is wounded, monks. The king is incapacitated. Had he not killed his father--that righteous man, that righteous king--the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye would have arisen to him as he sat in this very seat.\" That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words. Notes 1. Reading, Devo ca kalena kalam sammadharam anuppaveccheyya, with the Thai edition. 2. Mahaggatam. This term is used, together with \"immeasurable / unlimited,\" in the standard description of the awareness generated in the practice of the brahmaviharas (SN 42:8). According to Ven. Anuruddha in MN 127, however, an enlarged mind is not immeasurable. Its range of awareness is larger than the body but still measurable, ranging in distance from the shade of a tree to the earth bounded by the ocean. 3.

      "Title:  The Ball of Honey\n",
      "Original Text:  This discourse plays a central role in the early Buddhist analysis of conflict. As might be expected, the blame for conflict lies within, in the unskillful habits of the mind, rather than without. The culprit in this case is a habit called papanca. Unfortunately, none of the early texts give a clear definition of what the word papanca means, so it's hard to find a precise English equivalent for the term. However, they do give a clear analysis of how papanca arises, how it leads to conflict, and how it can be ended. In the final analysis, these are the questions that matter--more than the precise definition of terms--so we will deal with them first before proposing a few possible translation equivalents for the word. Three passages in the discourses--DN 21, MN 18, and Sn 4:11--map the causal processes that give rise to papanca and lead from papanca to conflict. Because the Buddhist analysis of causality is generally non-linear, with plenty of room for feedback loops, the maps vary in some of their details. In DN 21, the map reads like this: the perceptions & categories of papanca > thinking > desire > dear-&-not-dear > envy & stinginess > rivalry & hostility In Sn 4:11, the map is less linear and can be diagrammed like this: perception > the categories of papanca perception > name & form > contact > appealing & unappealing > desire > dear-&-not-dear > stinginess/divisiveness/quarrels/disputes In MN 18, the map is this: contact > feeling > perception > thinking > the perceptions & categories of papanca In this last case, however, the bare outline misses some of the important implications of the way this process is phrased. In the full passage, the analysis starts out in an impersonal tone: \"Dependent on eye & forms, eye-consciousness arises [similarly with the rest of the six senses]. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a requisite condition, there is feeling.\" Starting with feeling, the notion of an \"agent\"--in this case, the feeler--acting on \"objects,\" is introduced: \"What one feels, one perceives [labels in the mind]. What one perceives, one thinks about. What one thinks about, one 'papancizes.'\" Through the process of papanca, the agent then becomes a victim of his/her own patterns of thinking: \"Based on what a person papancizes, the perceptions & categories of papanca assail him/her with regard to past, present, & future forms cognizable via the eye [as with the remaining senses].\" What are these perceptions & categories that assail the person who papancizes? Sn 4:14 states that the root of the categories of papanca is the perception, \"I am the thinker.\" From this self-reflexive thought--in which one objectifies a \"self,\" a thing corresponding to the concept of \"I\"-- a number of categories can be derived: being/not-being, me/not-me, mine/not-mine, doer/done-to, signifier/signified. Once one's self becomes a thing under the rubric of these categories, it's impossible not to be assailed by the perceptions & categories derived from these basic distinctions. When there's the sense of identification as a being that needs to feed (see Khp 4), then based on the feelings arising from sensory contact, some feelings will seem appealing--worth feeding on--and others will seem worth pushing away. From this there grows desire, which comes into conflict with the desires of others who are also feeding because they, too, engage in papanca. This is how inner objectification breeds external contention. How can this process be ended? Through a shift in perception, caused by the way one attends to feelings, using the categories of appropriate attention (see MN 2). As the Buddha states in DN 21, rather than viewing a feeling as an appealing or unappealing thing, one should look at it as part of a causal process: When a particular feeling is pursued, do skillful or unskillful qualities increase in the mind? If skillful qualities increase, the feeling may be pursued. If unskillful qualities increase, it shouldn't. When comparing feelings that lead to skillful qualities, notice that those endowed with thinking (directed thought) and evaluation are less refined than those free of thinking and evaluation, as in the higher stages of mental absorption, or jhana. When seeing this, there is a tendency to opt for the more refined feelings, and this cuts through the act of thinking that, according to MN 18, provides the basis for papanca. In following this program, the notion of agent and victim is avoided, as is self-reflexive thinking in general. There is simply the analysis of cause-effect processes. One is still making use of dualities--distinguishing between unskillful and skillful (and affliction/lack of affliction, the results of unskillful and skillful qualities)--but the distinction is between processes, not things. Thus one's analysis avoids the type of thinking that, according to DN 21, depends on the perceptions and categories of papanca, and in this way the vicious cycle by which thinking and papanca keep feeding each other is cut. Ultimately, by following this program to greater and greater levels of refinement through the higher levels of mental absorption, one finds less and less to relish and enjoy in the six senses and the mental processes based on them. With this sense of disenchantment, the processes of feeling and thought are stilled, and there is a breakthrough to the cessation of the six sense spheres. When these spheres cease, is there anything else left? Ven. Sariputta, in AN 4:173 warns us not to ask, for to ask if there is, isn't, both-is-and-isn't, neither-is-nor-isn't anything left in that dimension is to papancize what is free from papanca. However, this dimension is not a total annihilation of experience. It's a type of experience that DN 11 calls consciousness without surface, luminous all around, where water, earth, fire, & wind have no footing, where long/short, coarse/fine, fair/foul, name/form are all brought to an end. This is the fruit of the path of arahantship--a path that makes use of dualities but leads to a fruit beyond them. It may come as cold comfort to realize that conflict can be totally overcome only with the realization of arahantship, but it's important to note that by following the path recommended in DN 21--learning to avoid references to any notion of \"self\" and learning to view feelings not as things but as parts of a causal process affecting the qualities in the mind--the basis for papanca is gradually undercut, and there are fewer and fewer occasions for conflict. In following this path, one reaps its increasing benefits all along the way. Translating papanca: As one writer has noted, the word papanca has had a wide variety of meanings in Indian thought, with only one constant: In Buddhist philosophical discourse it carries negative connotations, usually of falsification and distortion. The word itself is derived from a root that means diffuseness, spreading, proliferating. The Pali Commentaries define papanca as covering three types of thought: craving, conceit, and views. They also note that it functions to slow the mind down in its escape from samsara. Because its categories begin with the objectifying thought, \"I am the thinker,\" I have chosen to render the word as \"objectification,\" although some of the following alternatives might be acceptable as well: self-reflexive thinking, reification, proliferation, complication, elaboration, distortion. The word offers some interesting parallels to the postmodern notion of logocentric thinking, but it's important to note that the Buddha's program of deconstructing this process differs sharply from that of postmodern thought. * * * I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park. Then in the early morning, having adjusted his lower robe and taking his bowl & outer robe, he went into Kapilavatthu for alms. Having gone for alms in Kapilavatthu, after the meal, returning from his alms round, he went to the Great Forest for the day's abiding. Plunging into the Great Forest, he sat down at the root of a young clump of bamboo for the day's abiding. Dandapanin [\"Stick-in-hand\"] the Sakyan, out roaming & rambling for exercise, also went to the Great Forest. Plunging into the Great Forest, he went to the Blessed One under the young clump of bamboo. On arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he stood to one side. As he was standing there, he said to the Blessed One, \"What is the contemplative's doctrine? What does he proclaim?\" \"The sort of doctrine, friend, where one does not keep quarreling with anyone in the cosmos with its devas, Maras, & Brahmas, with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk; the sort (of doctrine) where perceptions no longer obsess the brahman who remains dissociated from sensuality, free from perplexity, his uncertainty cut away, devoid of craving for becoming & non-. Such is my doctrine; such is what I proclaim.\" When this was said, Dandapanin the Sakyan--shaking his head, wagging his tongue, raising his eyebrows so that his forehead was wrinkled in three furrows--left, leaning on his stick. Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion in the evening, went to the Banyan Park and, on arrival, sat down on a seat made ready. Having sat down, he [told the monks what had happened]. When this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One, \"Lord, what sort of doctrine is it where one does not keep quarreling with anyone in the cosmos with its devas, Maras, & Brahmas, with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk; where perceptions no longer obsess the brahman who remains dissociated from sensuality, free from perplexity, his uncertainty cut away, devoid of craving for becoming & non-?\" \"If, monk, with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions & categories of objectification assail a person, there is nothing there to relish, welcome, or remain fastened to, then that is the end of the obsessions of passion, the obsessions of resistance, the obsessions of views, the obsessions of uncertainty, the obsessions of conceit, the obsessions of passion for becoming, & the obsessions of ignorance. That is the end of taking up rods & bladed weapons, of arguments, quarrels, disputes, accusations, divisive speech, & false speech. That is where these evil, unskillful things cease without remainder.\" That is what the Blessed One said. Having said it, he--the One Well-Gone--got up from his seat and went into his dwelling. Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, this thought occurred to the monks: \"This brief statement the Blessed One made, after which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning--i.e., 'If, with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions & categories of objectification assail a person, there is nothing to relish... that is where these evil, unskillful things cease without remainder': Now who might analyze the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement?\" Then the thought occurred to them, \"Ven. Maha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his observant companions in the holy life. He is capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement. Suppose we were to go to him and, on arrival, cross-question him about this matter.\" So the monks went to Ven. Maha Kaccana and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, they sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they [told him what had happened, and added,] \"Analyze the meaning, Ven. Maha Kaccana!\" (He replied:) \"Friends, it's as if a man needing heartwood, looking for heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood--passing over the root & trunk of a standing tree possessing heartwood--were to imagine that heartwood should be sought among its branches & leaves. So it is with you, who--having bypassed the Blessed One when you were face to face with him, the Teacher--imagine that I should be asked about this matter. For knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees. He is the Eye, he is Knowledge, he is Dhamma, he is Brahma. He is the speaker, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver of the deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathagata. That was the time when you should have cross-questioned him about this matter. However he answered, that was how you should have remembered it.\" \"Yes, friend Kaccana: Knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees. He is the Eye, he is Knowledge, he is Dhamma, he is Brahma. He is the speaker, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver of the deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathagata. That was the time when we should have cross-questioned him about this matter. However he answered, that was how we should have remembered it. But you are praised by the Teacher and esteemed by your observant companions in the holy life. You are capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement. Analyze the meaning, Ven. Maha Kaccana, without making it difficult!\" \"In that case, my friends, listen & pay close attention. I will speak.\" \"As you say, friend,\" the monks responded to him. Ven. Maha Kaccana said this: \"Friends, concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made, after which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning--i.e., 'If, with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions & categories of objectification assail a person, there is nothing there to relish, welcome, or remain fastened to, then that is the end of the obsessions of passion, the obsessions of resistance, the obsessions of views, the obsessions of uncertainty, the obsessions of conceit, the obsessions of passion for becoming, & the obsessions of ignorance. That is the end of taking up rods & bladed weapons, of arguments, quarrels, disputes, accusations, divisive speech, & false speech. That is where these evil, unskillful things cease without remainder'--I understand the detailed meaning to be this: \"Dependent on eye & forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a requisite condition, there is feeling. What one feels, one perceives [labels in the mind]. What one perceives, one thinks about. What one thinks about, one complicates. Based on what a person complicates, the perceptions & categories of objectification assail him/her with regard to past, present, & future forms cognizable via the eye. \"Dependent on ear & sounds, ear-consciousness arises.... \"Dependent on nose & aromas, nose-consciousness arises.... \"Dependent on tongue & flavors, tongue-consciousness arises.... \"Dependent on body & tactile sensations, body-consciousness arises.... \"Dependent on intellect & ideas, intellect-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a requisite condition, there is feeling. What one feels, one perceives. What one perceives, one thinks about. What one thinks about, one complicates. Based on what a person complicates, the perceptions & categories of objectification assail him/her with regard to past, present, & future ideas cognizable via the intellect. \"Now, when there is the eye, when there are forms, when there is eye-consciousness, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of contact.1 When there is a delineation of contact, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of feeling. When there is a delineation of feeling, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of perception. When there is a delineation of perception, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking. When there is a delineation of thinking, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions & categories of objectification. \"When there is the ear.... \"When there is the nose.... \"When there is the tongue.... \"When there is the body.... \"When there is the intellect, when there are ideas, when there is intellect-consciousness, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of contact. When there is a delineation of contact, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of feeling. When there is a delineation of feeling, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of perception. When there is a delineation of perception, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking. When there is a delineation of thinking, it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions & categories of objectification. \"Now, when there is no eye, when there are no forms, when there is no eye-consciousness, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of contact. When there is no delineation of contact, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of feeling. When there is no delineation of feeling, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of perception. When there is no delineation of perception, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking.

When there is no delineation of perception, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking. When there is no delineation of thinking, it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions & categories of objectification. \"So, concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made, after which he entered his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning--i.e., 'If, with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions & categories of objectification assail a person, there is nothing there to relish, welcome, or remain fastened to, then that is the end of the obsessions of passion, the obsessions of resistance, the obsessions of views, the obsessions of uncertainty, the obsessions of conceit, the obsessions of passion for becoming, & the obsessions of ignorance. That is the end of taking up rods & bladed weapons, of arguments, quarrels, disputes, accusations, divisive speech, & false speech. That is where these evil, unskillful things cease without remainder'--this is how I understand the detailed meaning. Now, friends, if you wish, having gone to the Blessed One, cross-question him about this matter. However he answers is how you should remember it.\" Then the monks, delighting in & approving of Ven. Maha Kaccana's words, got up from their seats and went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to him, they sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they [told him what had happened after he had gone into his dwelling, and ended by saying,] \"Then Ven. Maha Kaccana analyzed the meaning using these words, these statements, these phrases.\" \"Maha Kaccana is wise, monks. He is a person of great discernment. If you had asked me about this matter, I too would have answered in the same way he did. That is its meaning, and that is how you should remember it.\" When this was said, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, \"Lord, it's as if a man--overcome with hunger, weakness, & thirst--were to come across a ball of honey. Wherever he might taste it, he would experience a sweet, delectable flavor. In the same way, wherever a monk of capable awareness might investigate the meaning of this Dhamma discourse with his discernment, he would experience gratification, he would experience confidence. What is the name of this Dhamma discourse?\" \"Then, Ananda, you can remember this Dhamma discourse as the 'Ball of Honey Discourse.'\" That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. Ananda delighted in the Blessed One's words. Note 1. The artificiality of this phrase--\"delineate a delineation\"--seems intentional. It underlines the artifice implicit in the process by which the mind, in singling out events, turns them into discrete things. See MN 109, note 2.
